# JSON Schemas

<span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT: files under release directory are generated automatically. DO NOT MODIFY THEM.**</span>

[JSON schemas](http://json-schema.org) under raw directory were generated from the RAML specification, then modified as source of truth after JSON schema became official modeling language for xdm. The release folder holds the xdm schemas generated from raw by removing tag numbers and changing formats etc..
